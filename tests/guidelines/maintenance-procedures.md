# Test Maintenance Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the ongoing maintenance procedures for the test suite to ensure high quality, maintainability, and effectiveness over time. These procedures are designed to prevent test technical debt and maintain the value of our testing investment.

## Daily Maintenance

### Developer Responsibilities

- **Before Committing**: Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
- **Code Review**: Include test quality assessment in all PR reviews
- **Test Updates**: Update tests when modifying functionality, not just when tests break
- **Coverage Monitoring**: Check coverage reports for new code additions

### Automated Checks

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatically run linting and basic test validation
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Enforce coverage thresholds and test quality gates
- **Coverage Reports**: Generate and review coverage reports on every build

## Weekly Maintenance

### Test Health Monitoring

Run the test health check utility weekly:

```bash
npm run test:health-check
```

This will identify:
- Slow-running tests (>5 seconds)
- Flaky tests with inconsistent results
- Tests with excessive mock complexity
- Outdated test patterns

### Performance Review

- **Execution Time**: Monitor total test suite execution time
- **Individual Test Performance**: Identify and optimize slow tests
- **Resource Usage**: Check memory and CPU usage during test runs
- **Parallel Execution**: Ensure tests can run safely in parallel

## Sprint Planning Integration

### Sprint Retrospectives

Include test maintenance as a standard retrospective topic:

1. **Test Quality Assessment**
   - Review test-related issues from the sprint
   - Identify patterns in test failures or maintenance overhead
   - Assess impact of test debt on development velocity

2. **Maintenance Task Planning**
   - Allocate 10-15% of sprint capacity for test maintenance
   - Prioritize high-impact test improvements
   - Schedule refactoring of problematic test areas

### Sprint Planning Checklist

- [ ] Review test health metrics from previous sprint
- [ ] Identify test maintenance tasks for upcoming sprint
- [ ] Allocate time for test refactoring and improvements
- [ ] Plan test updates for new features
- [ ] Schedule test guideline updates if needed

### Quarterly Reviews

Every quarter, conduct a comprehensive test suite review:

1. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Review overall coverage trends
   - Identify under-tested areas
   - Assess coverage quality vs quantity

2. **Pattern Compliance**
   - Audit test files for adherence to established patterns
   - Update guidelines based on lessons learned
   - Plan migration of legacy test patterns

3. **Tool and Framework Updates**
   - Evaluate testing tool updates
   - Plan migration to newer testing patterns
   - Update test templates and utilities

## Escalation Procedures

### Test Quality Issues

#### Level 1: Individual Developer
**Triggers:**
- Single test consistently failing
- Test taking longer than expected to write/maintain
- Uncertainty about testing approach

**Actions:**
1. Consult testing guidelines and templates
2. Review similar tests for patterns
3. Ask team members for guidance
4. Update test following established patterns

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Issue not resolved within 2 hours
- Pattern affects multiple tests
- Requires changes to testing infrastructure

#### Level 2: Team Lead/Senior Developer
**Triggers:**
- Multiple developers experiencing similar issues
- Test patterns causing widespread problems
- Coverage dropping below thresholds
- Test execution time increasing significantly

**Actions:**
1. Assess scope and impact of the issue
2. Determine if immediate fix or planned refactoring is needed
3. Update team guidelines if necessary
4. Plan refactoring tasks for upcoming sprints

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Issue affects entire team productivity
- Requires significant architectural changes
- Budget/timeline impact exceeds team authority

#### Level 3: Technical Leadership
**Triggers:**
- Test suite blocking development progress
- Major architectural changes needed
- Resource allocation decisions required
- Cross-team coordination needed

**Actions:**
1. Evaluate business impact and priorities
2. Allocate resources for comprehensive solution
3. Coordinate with other teams if necessary
4. Approve significant changes to testing strategy

### Coverage Threshold Violations

#### Immediate Response (Coverage < 70%)
1. **Block Deployment**: Prevent production deployment until coverage restored
2. **Identify Cause**: Determine what caused coverage drop
3. **Quick Fix**: Add minimal tests to restore threshold
4. **Plan Proper Solution**: Schedule comprehensive test addition

#### Sustained Low Coverage (Coverage < 80% for >1 week)
1. **Team Meeting**: Discuss coverage issues and solutions
2. **Action Plan**: Create specific plan to improve coverage
3. **Sprint Allocation**: Dedicate sprint capacity to test writing
4. **Process Review**: Evaluate why coverage dropped

### Test Performance Issues

#### Slow Test Suite (>5 minutes total)
1. **Profile Tests**: Identify slowest tests using test maintenance tools
2. **Optimize**: Refactor slow tests or improve test infrastructure
3. **Parallel Execution**: Ensure tests can run in parallel effectively
4. **Resource Allocation**: Consider infrastructure improvements

#### Flaky Tests (>5% failure rate)
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Skip flaky tests temporarily if blocking development
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate and fix underlying issues
3. **Pattern Review**: Check if flakiness indicates broader testing issues
4. **Prevention**: Update guidelines to prevent similar issues

## Maintenance Task Categories

### High Priority (Address Immediately)
- Tests blocking development or deployment
- Coverage dropping below critical thresholds (70%)
- Flaky tests causing CI/CD instability
- Security vulnerabilities in test dependencies

### Medium Priority (Address Within Sprint)
- Tests taking excessive time to run
- Outdated test patterns causing maintenance overhead
- Missing tests for critical functionality
- Test utilities needing updates

### Low Priority (Address in Quarterly Review)
- Test code style inconsistencies
- Opportunities for test consolidation
- Documentation updates
- Performance optimizations for stable tests

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators

1. **Coverage Metrics**
