# Migration Guide: License Change

## 🚨 Important License Change Notice

Starting with version **1.0.0**, Amazon Seller MCP has changed from MIT license to **AGPL-3.0 with commercial licensing options**.

## 📋 What This Means for You

### If You're Using Version 0.2.3 or Earlier (MIT License)
- ✅ **You can continue using** the MIT licensed version indefinitely
- ✅ **No immediate action required** - your usage remains valid
- ✅ **MIT license terms continue** to apply to your current installation
- ❌ **No new features or updates** will be provided for MIT version

### If You Upgrade to Version 1.0.0+ (AGPL-3.0)
You have two options:

#### Option 1: Open Source Use (Free)
- ✅ **Free to use** if your project is open source
- ✅ **Must license your project** under AGPL-3.0 or compatible license
