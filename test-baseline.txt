## Failed Test Details

### 1. API Error Handling Tests (20 failures)
**File**: tests/unit/api/api-error-handling.test.ts

**Issues**:
- Mock implementations returning success responses instead of errors
- Missing method implementations in API client classes
- Test expectations not matching actual behavior

**Specific Failures**:
- Token refresh failures not throwing AuthError
- Request signing failures not throwing AuthError
- Connection timeout/refused errors not throwing ApiError
- HTTP error responses (400, 401, 403, 429, 500) not throwing ApiError
- Retry logic not being triggered properly
- Client method calls failing due to missing implementations

### 2. Server Integration Tests (1 failure)
**File**: tests/unit/server/integration.test.ts

**Issue**: Resource handler error handling returning error response instead of throwing

### 3. Performance Optimization Tests (4 failures)
**File**: tests/unit/utils/performance-optimization.test.ts

**Issue**: Connection pool initialization failing due to HTTP agent event monitoring
**Error**: `TypeError: this.httpAgent.on is not a function`

### 4. Mock Factory Tests (1 failure)
**File**: tests/utils/mock-factories/api-client-factory.test.ts

**Issue**: Listings client mock returning `{listings: [], nextToken: null}` instead of `[]`

## Passing Test Categories
- Resource registration and management
- Authentication and credential management
- Tool registration and execution
- Notification systems (inventory and order)
- Data builders and test utilities
- Most API client functionality
- Server core functionality

## Test Infrastructure Health
- Mock factories mostly working
- Test data builders functional
- Test assertions working
- Test setup utilities operational

## Notes
- High pass rate (95.99%) indicates core functionality is working
- Failed tests are primarily in error handling and edge cases
- Mock implementations need alignment with actual API behavior
- Performance optimization features need connection pool fixes
