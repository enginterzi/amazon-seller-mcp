# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the comprehensive resolution of all linting issues in the Amazon Seller MCP Client project. The project currently has 6070 lint problems (5343 errors, 727 warnings) that need to be systematically fixed to maintain code quality, consistency, and adherence to the established coding standards. The lint issues span across multiple categories including Prettier formatting violations, TypeScript ESLint rule violations, unused variables, console statements, and code style inconsistencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Prettier formatting issues to be automatically fixed, so that the codebase maintains consistent formatting standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the lint fix process runs THEN all Prettier formatting errors SHALL be automatically resolved using the `--fix` option
2. WHEN formatting is applied THEN the code SHALL conform to the project's Prettier configuration (single quotes, 100 char width, 2 spaces)
3. WHEN formatting is complete THEN all indentation, spacing, and line break issues SHALL be corrected
4. WHEN the process completes THEN no Prettier-related lint errors SHALL remain

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript ESLint rule violations to be resolved, so that the code follows TypeScript best practices and maintains type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript lint issues are addressed THEN all `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` warnings SHALL be resolved by replacing `any` types with specific types
2. WHEN unused variables are identified THEN all `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` errors SHALL be resolved by either using the variables or removing them
3. WHEN require statements are found THEN all `@typescript-eslint/no-var-requires` errors SHALL be resolved by converting to ES6 imports
4. WHEN the process completes THEN all TypeScript ESLint rule violations SHALL be eliminated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all console statements to be properly handled, so that the codebase follows logging best practices and doesn't have inappropriate console usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN console statements are found in production code THEN they SHALL be replaced with proper logging using the Winston logger
2. WHEN console statements are found in test files THEN they SHALL be evaluated and either removed or replaced with appropriate test output methods
3. WHEN console statements are found in utility scripts THEN they SHALL be preserved if they serve a legitimate purpose or replaced with proper logging
4. WHEN the process completes THEN all inappropriate `no-console` violations SHALL be resolved

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the lint fix process to be systematic and safe, so that no functionality is broken during the cleanup process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the lint fix process begins THEN it SHALL start with automatic fixes using `npm run lint -- --fix`
2. WHEN automatic fixes are applied THEN the test suite SHALL be run to ensure no functionality is broken
3. WHEN manual fixes are required THEN they SHALL be applied incrementally with validation after each change
4. WHEN all fixes are complete THEN the final lint check SHALL show zero errors and warnings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper type definitions to replace all `any` types, so that the codebase maintains strong typing and catches potential runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `any` types are found in function parameters THEN they SHALL be replaced with specific interface definitions or union types
2. WHEN `any` types are found in return types THEN they SHALL be replaced with proper return type annotations
3. WHEN `any` types are found in variable declarations THEN they SHALL be replaced with inferred or explicit types
4. WHEN generic types are needed THEN proper generic constraints SHALL be used instead of `any`

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import/export statements to be properly formatted and organized, so that the module system is clean and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN import statements are found THEN they SHALL be organized according to the project's import ordering rules (Node.js built-ins, third-party, internal)
2. WHEN export statements are malformed THEN they SHALL be corrected to follow ES6 module syntax
3. WHEN unused imports are found THEN they SHALL be removed
4. WHEN the process completes THEN all import/export related lint issues SHALL be resolved
