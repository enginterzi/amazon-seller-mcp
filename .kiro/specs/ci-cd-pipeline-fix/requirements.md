# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is currently failing due to multiple critical quality issues that prevent successful builds and deployments. This feature addresses systematic resolution of lint errors, test failures, coverage issues, and quality gate enforcement to restore pipeline health and maintain development velocity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Lint Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all lint errors to be resolved so that the CI/CD pipeline can pass quality gates and maintain code consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the linting process runs THEN the system SHALL report zero lint errors
2. WHEN switch statements are used THEN the system SHALL use proper block scopes to avoid no-case-declarations errors
3. WHEN regex patterns are defined THEN the system SHALL remove unnecessary escape characters to resolve no-useless-escape errors
4. WHEN TypeScript code is written THEN the system SHALL remove all unused imports and variables to resolve @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars errors
5. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically validate lint rules and prevent commits with lint errors

### Requirement 2: Test Suite Stabilization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass consistently so that I can trust the test suite and deploy with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API error handling tests run THEN the system SHALL properly mock error scenarios instead of returning success responses
2. WHEN mock factories are used THEN the system SHALL provide complete method implementations with correct data structures
3. WHEN performance tests execute THEN the system SHALL properly configure connection pools and HTTP agents
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL achieve a pass rate of 100% with zero flaky tests
5. WHEN error scenarios are tested THEN the system SHALL validate proper error propagation and handling

### Requirement 3: Coverage Compliance

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want test coverage to meet quality thresholds so that code quality standards are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 80% line coverage
2. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 75% branch coverage
3. WHEN npm run test:coverage:threshold executes THEN the system SHALL properly enforce coverage thresholds
4. WHEN npm run test:quick-check executes THEN the system SHALL provide rapid health validation
5. WHEN coverage falls below thresholds THEN the system SHALL fail the build and provide clear feedback

### Requirement 4: CI Environment Dependencies

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all required dependencies to be available in the CI environment so that automated workflows can execute successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CI environment runs THEN the system SHALL have access to jq command for JSON parsing
2. WHEN floating point comparisons are needed THEN the system SHALL use bc command or awk fallback appropriately
3. WHEN test maintenance scripts execute THEN the system SHALL have all required Node.js dependencies available
4. WHEN CI workflows run THEN the system SHALL validate environment setup before executing quality checks
5. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and installation guidance

### Requirement 5: Script Execution Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all CI scripts to execute reliably so that automated quality checks provide accurate results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN node scripts/test-maintenance.js runs THEN the system SHALL successfully perform test health checking
2. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN the system SHALL produce valid JSON and markdown output
3. WHEN health reports are created THEN the system SHALL include accurate metrics and status information
4. WHEN scripts fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and recovery suggestions
5. WHEN scripts execute THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases and provide graceful error handling

### Requirement 6: Quality Gate Enforcement

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want strict quality gates to be enforced so that code quality standards are maintained consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is submitted THEN the system SHALL require zero lint errors before allowing merge
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL require 100% test pass rate before allowing merge
3. WHEN coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL enforce 80% line coverage and 75% branch coverage thresholds
4. WHEN builds are triggered THEN the system SHALL require successful compilation before allowing merge
5. WHEN quality gates fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback on what needs to be fixed

### Requirement 7: TypeScript Version Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript version compatibility to be maintained so that compilation is stable and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN the system SHALL use a supported TypeScript version (<5.4.0)
2. WHEN version conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear upgrade or downgrade guidance
3. WHEN TypeScript features are used THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with the target version
4. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL validate TypeScript version compatibility
5. WHEN compilation warnings occur THEN the system SHALL address version-related compatibility issues
