  - _Requirements: 2.1_

- [x] 2.2 Repair mock factory implementations
  - Review mock factories for missing method implementations
  - Fix data structure mismatches in mock responses

  - Address the 4 failing performance tests related to connection pools and HTTP agents
  - Properly configure connection pool settings in test setup
  - Fix HTTP agent configuration and resource cleanup in test teardown
  - _Requirements: 2.3_

- [x] 3. Coverage and quality gate restoration - Phase 3
  - Fix coverage reporting scripts and ensure quality gates work properly
  - Restore proper threshold enforcement
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 3.1 Fix coverage reporting scripts
  - Debug and fix `npm run test:coverage:threshold` script execution
  - Repair `npm run test:quick-check` for rapid health validation
  - Ensure coverage reports generate valid JSON and meet threshold requirements
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 3.2 Resolve CI environment dependencies
  - Ensure `jq` command is available in CI environment for JSON parsing
  - Implement `bc` command availability or `awk` fallback for floating point comparisons
  - Add environment validation checks before running quality scripts
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [x] 3.3 Fix test maintenance and health reporting scripts
  - Debug and repair `node scripts/test-maintenance.js` execution
  - Fix coverage report generation to produce valid JSON and markdown output
  - Ensure health reports include accurate metrics and status information
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 4. TypeScript version compatibility fix
  - Address TypeScript version compatibility issues
  - Ensure stable compilation with supported version
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2_

- [x] 4.1 Resolve TypeScript version compatibility
  - Evaluate current TypeScript 5.8.3 usage against supported version <5.4.0
  - Downgrade TypeScript to compatible version or update project to support 5.8.3
  - Test compilation and fix any version-related compatibility issues
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.5_

- [x] 5. Quality gate enforcement implementation
  - Implement strict quality gates to prevent future regressions
  - Ensure all quality checks are properly enforced
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 5.1 Implement pre-commit quality validation
  - Set up pre-commit hooks to validate lint rules before commits
  - Ensure zero lint errors are required before allowing commits
  - Add build validation to pre-commit process
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 6.1_

- [x] 5.2 Strengthen CI quality gate enforcement
  - Configure CI to require 100% test pass rate before merge
  - Enforce 80% line coverage and 75% branch coverage thresholds
  - Ensure build success is required before allowing merge
  - _Requirements: 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 6. Pipeline validation and monitoring
  - Validate that all fixes work together and pipeline passes completely
  - Implement monitoring to prevent future regressions
  - _Requirements: 6.5_

- [ ] 6.1 End-to-end pipeline validation
