# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The project is failing coverage thresholds due to untested TypeScript type definition files. Specifically, `src/types/amazon-api.ts` and `src/types/common.ts` have 0% line and statement coverage, failing to meet the required 80% threshold. This spec addresses the need to create comprehensive tests for these type definition files to ensure type safety, validate interface contracts, and meet quality gates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Type Definition Testing Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for type definitions, so that I can ensure type safety and interface contracts are validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN `src/types/amazon-api.ts` SHALL achieve at least 80% line coverage
2. WHEN the test suite runs THEN `src/types/amazon-api.ts` SHALL achieve at least 80% statement coverage  
3. WHEN the test suite runs THEN `src/types/common.ts` SHALL achieve at least 80% line coverage
4. WHEN the test suite runs THEN `src/types/common.ts` SHALL achieve at least 80% statement coverage
5. WHEN coverage thresholds are checked THEN all type files SHALL pass the minimum coverage requirements

### Requirement 2: Amazon API Type Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Amazon API type interfaces to be validated, so that I can ensure they correctly represent Amazon SP-API response structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing Amazon API types THEN all interface properties SHALL be validated for correct types
2. WHEN testing `AmazonCatalogItem` interface THEN all required and optional properties SHALL be verified
3. WHEN testing `AmazonListingsItem` interface THEN the structure SHALL match Amazon SP-API specifications
4. WHEN testing `AmazonInventorySummary` interface THEN inventory-specific properties SHALL be validated
5. WHEN testing `AmazonOrder` interface THEN order structure SHALL be verified for completeness
6. WHEN testing `AmazonReport` interface THEN report metadata properties SHALL be validated
7. WHEN testing filter parameter interfaces THEN all filtering options SHALL be verified

### Requirement 3: Common Type Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want common type definitions to be validated, so that I can ensure consistent error handling and logging structures across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing `ErrorDetails` interface THEN all error properties SHALL be validated for correct types
2. WHEN testing `LogMetadata` interface THEN logging structure SHALL be verified
3. WHEN testing `ErrorRecoveryContext` interface THEN retry mechanism properties SHALL be validated
4. WHEN testing `McpRequestBody` interface THEN MCP protocol compliance SHALL be verified
5. WHEN testing `NotificationData` interface THEN event structure SHALL be validated
6. WHEN testing HTTP request/response interfaces THEN web server compatibility SHALL be verified

### Requirement 4: Type Safety and Runtime Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type definitions to include runtime validation helpers, so that I can ensure data integrity at runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating type validation functions THEN they SHALL use Zod schemas for runtime validation
2. WHEN validating Amazon API responses THEN type guards SHALL verify structure correctness
3. WHEN processing user inputs THEN validation functions SHALL sanitize and validate data
4. WHEN handling error objects THEN type guards SHALL identify error types correctly
5. WHEN processing MCP requests THEN validation SHALL ensure protocol compliance

### Requirement 5: Test Quality and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want high-quality tests for type definitions, so that I can maintain type safety as the codebase evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing type tests THEN they SHALL follow established testing patterns from the codebase
2. WHEN creating test data THEN TestDataBuilder SHALL be used for complex objects
3. WHEN testing interfaces THEN both valid and invalid data scenarios SHALL be covered
4. WHEN testing optional properties THEN undefined and null cases SHALL be validated
5. WHEN testing union types THEN all possible type combinations SHALL be verified
6. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL be deterministic and not rely on external dependencies

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing Test Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type tests to integrate seamlessly with existing test infrastructure, so that I can maintain consistent testing practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating type tests THEN they SHALL use centralized mock factories from `tests/utils/mock-factories/`
2. WHEN organizing test files THEN they SHALL follow the established directory structure in `tests/unit/types/`
3. WHEN writing test descriptions THEN they SHALL be behavior-focused and follow 2-level nesting maximum
4. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL integrate with existing CI/CD pipeline and coverage reporting
5. WHEN tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages indicating type validation failures
