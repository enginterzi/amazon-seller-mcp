# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refactoring and improving the existing test suite to make tests more maintainable, readable, and efficient. The current test suite has issues with complex mock setups, nested describe blocks, and maintenance overhead that exceeds the value provided. This refactoring will transform tests from a liability into an asset by focusing on behavior testing, simplifying test structure, and establishing clear testing guidelines.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consolidated and simplified mock setups, so that I can write and maintain tests more efficiently without duplicating mock configuration across test files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test file requires mocking THEN the system SHALL use centralized mock utilities that can be reused across multiple test files
2. WHEN setting up mocks for similar functionality THEN the system SHALL eliminate duplicate mock configurations by using shared mock factories
3. WHEN a mock setup changes THEN the system SHALL require updates in only one location rather than multiple test files
4. IF a test requires specific mock behavior THEN the system SHALL allow easy customization of the base mock setup without affecting other tests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate nested describe blocks in tests, so that test structure is flatter, more readable, and easier to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing test cases THEN the system SHALL use a maximum of two levels of describe blocks (main describe and optional grouping describe)
2. WHEN writing test descriptions THEN the system SHALL use clear, descriptive test names that eliminate the need for deep nesting
3. WHEN grouping related tests THEN the system SHALL prefer flat structure with descriptive test names over nested describe blocks
4. IF test organization requires grouping THEN the system SHALL use logical grouping that enhances readability rather than creating hierarchy for hierarchy's sake

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that focus on behavior rather than implementation details, so that tests remain stable when internal implementation changes but behavior stays the same.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL test user-facing behavior and public API contracts rather than internal implementation details
2. WHEN testing a component THEN the system SHALL verify expected outputs and side effects rather than internal method calls
3. WHEN implementation changes but behavior remains the same THEN the system SHALL require minimal or no test updates
4. IF testing requires verification of interactions THEN the system SHALL focus on meaningful interactions that affect user experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a development team, I want comprehensive test guidelines and templates, so that all team members write consistent, maintainable tests following established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer writes new tests THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidelines for test structure, naming, and organization
2. WHEN starting a new test file THEN the system SHALL offer templates that follow established patterns for different types of tests
3. WHEN reviewing test code THEN the system SHALL provide a checklist to ensure tests meet quality standards
4. IF a developer is unsure about testing approach THEN the system SHALL provide examples and patterns for common testing scenarios

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a development team, I want test utilities and helpers, so that common testing operations are simplified and standardized across the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests need common setup operations THEN the system SHALL provide reusable utility functions that encapsulate these operations
2. WHEN creating test data THEN the system SHALL offer factory functions or builders that generate consistent test fixtures
3. WHEN asserting complex conditions THEN the system SHALL provide custom matchers or assertion helpers that improve test readability
4. IF multiple tests need similar helper functions THEN the system SHALL centralize these helpers to avoid duplication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a development team, I want to establish and maintain test coverage goals, so that critical functionality is adequately tested without over-testing implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring test coverage THEN the system SHALL achieve 80% line coverage as a baseline goal
2. WHEN testing critical paths THEN the system SHALL achieve 100% coverage for essential user workflows and error handling
3. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN the system SHALL identify areas that need additional testing focus
4. IF coverage drops below established thresholds THEN the system SHALL alert the team and prevent deployment until coverage is restored

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a development team, I want a continuous improvement process for test maintenance, so that test quality remains high and technical debt is minimized over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting code reviews THEN the system SHALL include test quality as part of the review checklist
2. WHEN planning development sprints THEN the system SHALL allocate time for regular test maintenance and improvement
3. WHEN tests become difficult to maintain THEN the system SHALL provide a process for identifying and refactoring problematic tests
4. IF test maintenance overhead becomes excessive THEN the system SHALL trigger a review and refactoring of the affected test areas
