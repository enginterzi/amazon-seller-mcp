# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves renaming the project from "amazon-seller-mcp-client" to "amazon-seller-mcp" to better represent its purpose. The renaming should be comprehensive, updating the folder name and all references throughout the codebase, documentation, and configuration files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project folder to be renamed from "amazon-seller-mcp-client" to "amazon-seller-mcp", so that the project name better reflects its purpose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the renaming is complete THEN the main project folder SHALL be named "amazon-seller-mcp"
2. WHEN the folder is renamed THEN all file paths and references SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all package.json references updated, so that the npm package name reflects the new project name.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package.json is updated THEN the "name" field SHALL be "amazon-seller-mcp"
2. IF there are any internal package references THEN they SHALL be updated to use the new name
3. WHEN the package is built THEN it SHALL use the new name in generated artifacts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all documentation updated, so that references to the old name are replaced with the new name.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is updated THEN README.md SHALL reference "amazon-seller-mcp" instead of "amazon-seller-mcp-client"
2. WHEN documentation is updated THEN all .md files SHALL use the new project name consistently
3. WHEN documentation is updated THEN installation and usage instructions SHALL reflect the new name

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all code references updated, so that any hardcoded project names use the new name.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is scanned THEN any string literals containing "amazon-seller-mcp-client" SHALL be updated to "amazon-seller-mcp"
2. WHEN imports or module references exist THEN they SHALL be updated if they reference the old name
3. WHEN configuration files are updated THEN they SHALL use the new project name

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all build and configuration files updated, so that the project builds correctly with the new name.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tsconfig.json is reviewed THEN any project-specific references SHALL use the new name
2. WHEN build scripts are reviewed THEN they SHALL reference the correct project name
3. WHEN the project is built THEN it SHALL complete successfully with the new name
