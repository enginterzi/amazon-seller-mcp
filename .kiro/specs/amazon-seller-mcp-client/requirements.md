# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Amazon Seller MCP Client is a Node.js library that integrates the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with the Amazon Selling Partner API. This integration enables AI agents to interact with Amazon Seller accounts through a standardized protocol, allowing for automated management of product listings, inventory, orders, and other seller operations. The client will serve as a bridge between AI agents and the Amazon Selling Partner API, providing context-aware tools and resources for effective e-commerce management.
