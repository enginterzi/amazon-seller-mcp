- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor test execution times

### Weekly Procedures
- **Test Health Review**: Check test maintenance score and trends
- **Mock Factory Updates**: Update mock factories for new API changes
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep testing guidelines current

### Monthly Procedures
- **Comprehensive Health Check**: Full test suite analysis
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify and fix slow tests
- **Pattern Compliance Review**: Ensure new tests follow established patterns

### Quarterly Procedures
- **Refactoring Sprint**: Dedicated time for test improvement
- **Guidelines Review**: Update testing standards based on learnings
- **Tool Enhancement**: Improve test utilities and infrastructure

## Quality Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Test Pass Rate**: Target 95%+ (Currently 82.8%)
2. **Coverage Metrics**: 80% line, 75% branch minimum
3. **Test Maintenance Score**: Target 75+/100 (Currently 65/100)
4. **Execution Performance**: Average test time <2 seconds
5. **Mock Complexity**: Keep mock setup simple and reusable

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Daily health check
npm run test:quick-check

# Weekly comprehensive analysis
npm run test:health-check

# Monthly detailed report
npm run test:maintenance export markdown > monthly-report.md

# Coverage validation
npm run test:coverage:threshold
```

## Issue Resolution Procedures

### Critical Issues (Immediate Response)
**Criteria**: Test pass rate drops below 90%
**Response Time**: Within 4 hours
**Actions**:
1. Identify root cause using test health checker
2. Apply immediate fixes or disable problematic tests
3. Create issue ticket for permanent resolution
4. Notify team of temporary measures

### High Priority Issues (Same Day Response)
**Criteria**: 
- Test maintenance score drops below 60/100
- Coverage drops below 75%
- New test failures in critical paths

**Actions**:
1. Analyze issue using maintenance tools
2. Apply fixes within same day
3. Update documentation if patterns changed
4. Review with team lead

### Medium Priority Issues (Weekly Response)
**Criteria**:
- Individual test execution time >5 seconds
- Mock complexity increases
- Pattern violations in new tests

**Actions**:
1. Schedule fix during weekly maintenance window
2. Refactor problematic tests
3. Update guidelines if needed
4. Provide team feedback

## Team Responsibilities

### All Developers
- **Write Tests**: Follow established patterns and guidelines
- **Maintain Tests**: Update tests when changing related code
- **Report Issues**: Use test health tools to identify problems
- **Follow Guidelines**: Adhere to testing standards and best practices

### Test Champions (Rotating Role)
- **Weekly Reviews**: Conduct test health assessments
- **Pattern Enforcement**: Ensure new tests follow guidelines
- **Tool Maintenance**: Keep test utilities updated
- **Team Education**: Share testing knowledge and improvements

### Tech Lead
- **Strategic Planning**: Plan quarterly refactoring sprints
- **Resource Allocation**: Ensure adequate time for test maintenance
- **Quality Standards**: Set and enforce testing quality standards
- **Tool Investment**: Approve improvements to testing infrastructure

## Escalation Procedures

### Level 1: Developer Self-Service
**Tools Available**:
- Test health checker for issue identification
- Mock factories for standardized setup
- Test templates for new test creation
- Documentation for guidance

### Level 2: Team Support
**When to Escalate**: 
- Unable to resolve issue within 2 hours
- Pattern violations requiring guidance
- Mock factory updates needed

**Process**:
1. Post in team chat with test health report
2. Tag test champion for assistance
3. Schedule pair programming session if needed

### Level 3: Technical Leadership
**When to Escalate**:
- Test pass rate below 85% for >24 hours
- Infrastructure changes needed
- Resource allocation required

**Process**:
1. Create formal issue ticket
2. Include comprehensive analysis
3. Propose solution with timeline
4. Schedule review meeting

## Continuous Improvement Process

### Monthly Review Cycle
1. **Collect Metrics**: Gather test health data
2. **Identify Trends**: Analyze patterns and issues
3. **Plan Improvements**: Prioritize enhancement opportunities
4. **Implement Changes**: Execute improvement plan
5. **Measure Impact**: Validate improvements

### Quarterly Planning
1. **Strategic Assessment**: Review testing strategy alignment
2. **Tool Evaluation**: Assess need for new testing tools
3. **Pattern Evolution**: Update guidelines based on learnings
4. **Team Training**: Plan skill development activities

### Annual Review
1. **ROI Analysis**: Measure testing investment returns
2. **Technology Updates**: Evaluate new testing technologies
3. **Process Optimization**: Streamline maintenance procedures
4. **Long-term Planning**: Set testing strategy for next year

## Emergency Procedures

### Test Suite Failure (>50% tests failing)
1. **Immediate**: Disable failing tests to unblock development
2. **Within 2 hours**: Identify root cause (infrastructure, dependencies, etc.)
3. **Within 4 hours**: Implement temporary fix or rollback
4. **Within 24 hours**: Permanent resolution and post-mortem

### Infrastructure Issues
1. **Mock Factory Problems**: Use backup mock implementations
2. **CI/CD Pipeline Issues**: Run tests locally, fix pipeline ASAP
3. **Dependency Updates**: Rollback breaking changes, plan upgrade
4. **Performance Degradation**: Identify slow tests, optimize or disable
